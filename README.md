# Description
low-latency real-time object detection and tracking pipeline built in Python, featuring zero-allocation preprocessing, optimized GDI-based screen capture, and GPU-accelerated inference via ONNX Runtime with TensorRT and CUDA backends. Designed for high-FPS, production-grade performance experimentation.
## How does my script Work?
Host Environment (Game / Visual Source)
The system continuously observes a real-time visual environment generated by an external application (e.g., a game).

Optimized Screen Capture Stage
A low-level screen capture mechanism (GDI + DIB section) extracts raw frame data with minimal memory overhead and predictable latency.

Neural Inference Stage
Captured frames are passed directly into a YOLO-based object detection model executed via:

ONNX Runtime

DirectML / CUDA / TensorRT backend

This stage identifies targets and outputs bounding boxes and confidence scores.

Decision & Control Logic
Detection results are fed into a decision module that:

Selects the optimal target

Applies spatial filtering (FOV constraints)

Computes positional deltas (X/Y adjustments)

Applies smoothing and prediction logic if enabled

Input Actuation Layer
The computed adjustments are translated into controlled mouse input, moving the cursor toward the selected target with configurable behavior.

Trigger Logic (Optional)
Based on confidence thresholds and alignment conditions, automated trigger logic can activate input actions.

Feedback Loop
The system immediately re-enters the capture phase, forming a continuous real-time loop with frame-level responsiveness.


# What is the purpose of my script?

## it was designed for Gamers who are at a severe disadvantage over normal gamers.
### This includes but is not limited to:

- Gamers who are physically challenged
- Gamers who are mentally challenged
- Gamers who suffer from untreated/untreatable visual impairments
- Gamers who do not have access to a seperate Human-Interface Device (HID) for controlling the pointer
- Gamers trying to improve their reaction time
- Gamers with poor Hand/Eye coordination
- Gamers who perform poorly in FPS games
- Gamers who play for long periods in hot environments, causing greasy hands that make aiming difficult
